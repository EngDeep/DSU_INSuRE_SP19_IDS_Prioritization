## Project Description
We researched data science and machine learning techniques that can be used to fine tune an Intrusion Detection System (IDS).  The goal of this research was to create a working prototype to aid in the reduction of customizations organizations need to make when implementing and maintaining a working and effective IDS.  This prototype could then be further enhanced by future research teams.


## Research Problem
IDS require extensive and continuous adjustments for the specific network they are deployed on.  Efforts are needed to reduce the high number of false positives that signatures are generating.  These false positives lead to analysts spending much of their time in assessment or simply turning them off to avoid the distraction which then leaves their systems vulnerable.
## Objectives
We are seeking a way to combine these weak, high-false-positive signatures to generate low-false-positive strong indicators.  We seek to do this by:Exploring the nature of these low priority alerts to determine which combinations produce a strong indicator of intrusion.Determine any currently established models for pattern recognition.In the absence of a working model, create our own model for testing.Use this working model to then apply data analysis techniques to look for unknown patterns.Test this working model against a large dataset with the intention of implementation in an IDS platform
